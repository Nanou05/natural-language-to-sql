By Naima OUBENALI
Assignment for: Hawawou Oumarou Tchapchet

## Project Overview
In this week-long project, you will develop a model that converts natural language questions into SQL queries. This task is fundamental in making databases more accessible to non-technical users and has applications in chatbots, voice assistants, and database interfaces.

## Objectives
1. Implement a basic Text-to-SQL conversion system
2. Experiment with different model architectures or fine-tuning strategies
3. Evaluate the model's performance on a standard dataset
4. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of your approach

## Dataset
You will use the WikiSQL dataset, which contains:
- A large collection of tables
- Natural language questions about these tables
- Corresponding SQL queries

Alternative: If time permits, you may explore the Spider dataset, which is more complex and involves multiple tables.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing (Day 1)
- Load and explore the WikiSQL dataset
- Analyze the structure of the questions, SQL queries, and tables
- Preprocess the data (tokenization, encoding, etc.)

### 2. Model Selection and Implementation (Days 2-3-4)
Choose one of the following approaches:
a) Fine-tune a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, T5)
b) Implement a sequence-to-sequence model with attention
c) Develop a rule-based system combined with machine learning

Implement your chosen approach, focusing on the core functionality.

### 3. Training and Initial Evaluation (Day 5)
- Set up the training pipeline
- Train your model on a subset of the data
- Perform initial evaluation and error analysis

### 4. Optimization and Final Evaluation (Day 6)
- Optimize your model based on initial results
- Train on the full dataset (or a larger subset)
- Conduct a thorough evaluation, including:
  - Exact match accuracy
  - Execution accuracy (if possible)
  - Analysis of error types

### 5. Documentation and Presentation (Day 7)
- Document your approach, including:
  - Model architecture
  - Training process
  - Evaluation results
  - Error analysis
  - Challenges faced and potential improvements
- Prepare a brief presentation or demo of your system

## Deliverables
1. .py files containing your code
2. Jupyter notebook containing your analysis
3. A brief report/ readme.md file(2-3 pages) summarizing your approach and findings
4. A small demo that showcases your model's capabilities (date to be decided together)

## Additional Challenges (if time permits)
- Implement a simple web interface for your Text-to-SQL system
- Explore handling more complex queries (e.g., joins, aggregations)
- Investigate techniques for making your model more interpretable

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality of the Text-to-SQL conversion
- Quality of code and documentation
- Depth of analysis and understanding of the problem
- Creativity in approach and problem-solving

Remember, the goal is not to create a state-of-the-art system in a week, but to gain hands-on experience with Text-to-SQL conversion and to demonstrate your ability to approach and analyze an NLP problem.

Good luck with your project!
